Javascript has 2 kinds of variables, objects and primitives. 
Null and Undefined are different in Javascript.
let is block scoped and var is function scoped. However we shouldn't use var.
Always properly declare variables.
When you try to convert a string that is not convertible to a number to a number using Number 
command it will give NaN as output.
typeof works the same as in python
String used to convert a number to a string
Javascript has the concept of Truthy and Falsy values. Values that will become true or false 
when we try to convert them into boolean. JS has only 5 Falsy values so it is best to memorize them
rather than worrying about Truthy ones.
5 falsy values are 0, '', null, undefined, NaN. boolean(0)==False, boolean('')==False and so on.
Javascript has === which is the strict equality operator and the loose 
equality operator == which performs type conversion
Babel is a tool to transpile the code so that it can run on all web browsers the same way.
Transpiling and Polyfilling are two tasks needed to make frontend code compatible on all browsers.
Strict mode is a special mode we can activate in Javascript which makes it easier
for us to write secure Javascript code. We do it by writing 'use strict'; at the top of the js file.
